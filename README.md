# Hi, I'm Angelika 👋

The technical part 🤖:

- I call myself a **full-stack web developer** because I like to be involved in many different aspects of creating and maintaining web apps.

- I write backend code in **Elixir** 💜. 
    - It's my favorite programming language because of its human-friendly syntax, immutability, pattern matching, and performance.
    - In my spare time, I help out with Elixir on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) by mentoring and maintaining the track.

- I love making websites pretty with **CSS** 🎨.
    - Sometimes I do weird things with it just to see if I can and I publish it on [css-art.angelika.me](https://css-art.angelika.me).

- I like working on client-side **JavaScript** code too...
    - ...but I am not a fan of the current trend of making _everything_ a single-page application. Rendering HTML on the backend is still my default choice.
    - I don't care much about which JavaScript framework I use...
    - ...but **I do care about [web accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_accessibility)**.

- Sometimes I write down my thoughts on any of the above topics on **[my blog](https://angelika.me)** 📘.

- If you want to talk to me about ✨tech stuff✨, you can DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/atyborska93) or write an email to `hello at angelika.me`.

The human part 👩:

- I live in Berlin, Germany 🇩🇪.
    - ...but I was born and raised in Gorzów Wielkopolski, Poland 🇵🇱.

- I speak English, Polish, and broken German (work in progess!).

- When I'm not coding, I:
  - Scroll my Twitter feed a bit too much 😰.
  - Play boardgames 🎲.
  - Go to the gym 💪.
  - Watch TV series and movies 📽.
